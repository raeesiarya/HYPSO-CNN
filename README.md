# 1D CNN for Sea/Land/Cloud Classification of Hyperspectral Images from the HYPSO-2 Satellite

This project implements the 1D-JustoLiuNet for classification tasks on hyperspectral satellite image captures from the HYPSO-2 satellite.
The 1D-JustoLiuNet model is based on recent work by Justo et al. (2023) and optimized for deployment in resource-constrained satellite environments.

Full theoretical background, model design, evaluation metrics, and experimental results are presented in the accompanying [final report PDF](readme_files/Final_Report_1D-JustoLiuNet_HYPSO-2.pdf), submitted as part of an academic research contribution at NTNU SmallSat Lab.

## Requirements

- CUDA version: 12.6
- UBUNTU version: 22.04
- NVIDIA driver version: 565.57.01

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/raeesiarya/HYPSO-CNN.git
    ```

2. Install required packages:
    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```   

This project used Python 3.12.3 in a virtual `venv` environment.

3. Prepare your dataset:
    1. Get the raw data from HYPSO-2:
        ```bash
        python3 scraping/get_data1.py
        ```
    2. Run the function `create_csv_file` in `manage_data.py` to create CSV files with correct paths.

4. Train and evaluate the model:

    ```bash
    python3 scripts/train.py
    ```
